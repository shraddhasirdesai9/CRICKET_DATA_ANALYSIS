# CRICKET_DATA_ANALYSIS

In this SQL project, using batting and bowling data tables.Each file consists of both batting and bowling data of players from 12 different teams in IPL, ODI, T20, and Test Cricket till 16 Jan 2021. 
I have done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivanshsinghal107/cricbuzz-players-data

I used MS-SQL Workbench and imported the CSV files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
